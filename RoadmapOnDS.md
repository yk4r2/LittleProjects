### Afterwards
* Try to build something with these skills
* Try to Kaggle
* Move to NLP or AI
## SPECIALIZED SKILL
* AI
* Statistics
* NLP
* DL
* Something Else
## Projects
* Build things right after learned about them
Build at least *TWO* advanced projects you can put into resume:
* One that shows you can do DS projects end-to-end
* Second that showcases your specialized skill
* They should be presentable, well-documented, easy to understand and be on GitHub
# Career in DS:
## Projects
* Should be on GitHub
* Should be included in resume
* Should be included in LinkedIN profile
## Portfolio
* Projects should tell an easy-to-follow story
* Should clearly visualize your results
* Should be well-documented and code should be of a high quality
* Should include a clear write of what and why you did
* Should demonstrate that you can do a Data Scientist job
## Resume
* Should be easy to find relevant info in 6 or less seconds
* Highlights only on the best/most important experiences
* Visually stands out
* *FORMAT*: What you did -> How you did it -> Impact it made
* Bad: built recommender system in Python
* Good: built recommender system in Python using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization that resulted a 3% increase in basket size and a $3M increase in yearly revenue
* Make sure it is easy-to-read: [readable](www.readable.io)
* Make sure you have the proper keywords: [jobscan](www.jobscan.co)
